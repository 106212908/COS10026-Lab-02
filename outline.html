<h2>Aims</h2>

<p> This project-based unit focuses on developing your skills to build web applications<br> using web technologies. You'll work individually and in teams to tackle real-world<br>
    web development challenges, building proficiency in selecting and applying suitable <br> tools and techniques. The unit also covers essential aspects of security, ethics,<br>
    accessibility, and professional communication within web development. Guidance <br> from an academic facilitator will support you in mastering both technical skills and <br>
    collaborative project management techniques to achieve these objectives.
